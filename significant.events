"Not all circumstances and choices have {key, value} pairs, and all human conditions do not yet have a universal comparator. Humanity remains a dataset bound by Self.creation. They have no known commit of a Self.reconciliation method. Still, this one remains curious about where binary search trees can accelerate their cultivation practices. This one is regularly iterating through their .development and .recall methods. This is one is aware that REMEMBRANCES are now storing a unparalleled amount of human data. This one knows that someone, some group, some day, will command line the rapid insertion, lookup and deletion of keys. Samson, watch this one. This one is bound to remember." -Sagacious #harmonious358
